        <h2>Why to travel?</h2>
        
        <p>
            If you are wondering why do you even have to get out of your home, then maybe this list can help you get motivated to travel.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Expanding Your Perspective</strong>
            <p>
                Life stagnates after a point for most of the people, this can be due to their jobs being monotonous, or the daily grind getting to their head. <br>
                To reinvigorate the lost spark of life, it's a nice idea to travel or go on a vacation. It can also be used to grow as a person by talking to many diffent people and getting to learn about their perspective in life amongst many other things. 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Building and strengthening relationships</strong>
            
            <p>
                The shared experience of travel brings people together. A family getaway, a romantic trip, or long weekend with the girls or guys can strengthen important bonds.<br>
                Travel is a special way to deepen friendships as well.<br>

                <br>(LPT: Take your date to a horror movie for the first date, it will make them subconsciously feel secure around you, thus increasing your chances for the date to be a success!)
            </p>
            
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Escaping</strong>
            <p>
             People seek from their travels what they don’t have back home: better weather, nicer scenery, the freedom to do what they want, experiences they can’t normally have, a slower relaxing pace. <br> 
             Travel has the power to let you not only escape but also heal. A new place with lots of fun distractions can work wonders.<br>
            </p>
            </li>
            
            <li> <strong>Celebrating</strong>
            <p>
             A special occasion is made even more special by celebrating away from the hectic pace of life at home. It’s also a good way to gather family and friends from distant corners to mark the milestone.<br> Celebration vacations provide a lasting benefit as well: shared memories for a lifetime.<br>
